DNS resolver - By Ben Campbell

This is a program that is built to query DNS and retrieve records about the given domain name.
I believe that the only thing that I didn't finish implementing in this program is the time it takes for each iteration.
However, it does give the total time it took to retrieve the record.

The resolver can be run by typing:

python myresolver.py commandfile.txt

where commandfile.txt is the name of the command file.
